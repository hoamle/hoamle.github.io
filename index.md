I am a Data Scientist at [NextSmarty](https://www.nextsmarty.com/) - a Hanoi-based startup which provide on-premise solutions for personalized recommendation service. Before that, I was a Research Assistant at the <a href="http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn">Data Science Lab, Hanoi University of Science Technology</a> (DSLab-HUST), reading Statistical Machine Learning. 

I have strong research interests in ***(deep) generative modelling***, as a mean to reconstruct data generating process via prior [structure *and* architecture](/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning#arc) of a learning model. In particular, I am interested in (i) disentangling major factors of variation for better interpretation of data, and (ii) <a href="/articles/17/computers-can-draw">inspiring downstream applications</a> of generative modelling in computer vision/graphics. 

In my earlier journey, I had a brief but wonderful time as a developer at <a href="https://www.fpt-software.com/">FPT Software</a> Hanoi, and was a summer intern at Dr <a href="http://lenoverelab.org">Le Novere's computational biology lab</a>. I completed a M.Phil. in Computational Biology at <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge University</a> in 2014, and a B.Sc. in Mathematics  with Finance  at <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/">Exeter University</a> the year before.
