I am a freelance Machine Learning/A.I. practitioner, and was a former Research Assistant at the <a href="http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn">Data Science Lab, Hanoi University of Science Technology</a> (DSLab-HUST), who read and worked on **Statistical Machine Learning**. 

I have strong research interests in <i>deep neural networks</i> and <i>latent (probabilistic) variable models</i>, which - together - form a broader interest in ***(deep) generative modelling***, as a mean to solve ill-posed inverse problems in e.g. computer vision, bioinformatics. In particular, I am driven by the works that attempt to reconstruct data generating process via [structure *and* architecture](/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning#arc) of a learning model, such that major factors of variation of a system can be recovered and/or intuitively explained. On the other hand, <a href="/articles/17/computers-can-draw">inspiring applications</a> in computer vision/graphics, coupled with a long-term hobby in arts, are also a major motivation for my interest in generative modelling.

In my earlier journey, I had a brief but wonderful time as a developer at <a href="https://www.fpt-software.com/">FPT Software</a> Hanoi, and was a summer intern at Dr <a href="http://lenoverelab.org">Le Novere's computational biology lab</a>. I completed a M.Phil. in Computational Biology at <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge University</a> in 2014, and a B.Sc. in Mathematics  with Finance  at <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/">Exeter University</a> in 2013. Before that, I was a B.A. student at the <a href="http://bsneu.edu.vn/?q=en">Business school, National Economics University</a> for one year.
