I am a freelancer & a Research Assistant at the <a href="http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn">Data Science Lab, Hanoi University of Science Technology</a> (DSLab-HUST), reading and working on ***Statistical Machine Learning***. I have strong research interests in <i>deep neural networks</i> and <i>latent variable models</i>, which - together - form a broader interest in <strong>(deep) generative probabilistic models</strong>. In particular, I am driven by the works that attempt to reconstruct data generating process, via [structure *and* architecture](/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning#arc) of a model, which would bring highly beneficial impact to other domains (e.g. computer graphics, bioinformatics) in explaining and/or recovering important factors of variation in a system. On another hand, <a href="/articles/17/computers-can-draw">inspiring applications</a> in computer vision/graphics, coupled with a long-term hobby in arts, are also a major motivation for my interest in generative modelling.

In my earlier journey, I had a brief but wonderful time at <a href="https://www.fpt-software.com/">FPT Software</a> Hanoi, and was a summer intern at Dr <a href="http://lenoverelab.org">Le Novere's lab</a>. I completed a M.Phil. in Computational Biology at <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge University</a> in 2014, and a B.Sc. in Mathematics  with Finance  at <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/">Exeter University</a> in 2013. Before that, I was a B.A. student at the <a href="http://bsneu.edu.vn/?q=en">Business school, National Economics University</a> for one year.
