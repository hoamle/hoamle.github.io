<p>I am a research assistant/student at the <a href="http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn">Data Science Lab, Hanoi University of Science & Technology</a> (DSLab-HUST), reading and working on statistical machine learning. My research interests include <i>deep neural networks</i> and <i>latent variable models</i>, with focus on <strong>informative deep probabilistic models</strong>  that endorse interpretability and scalability for downstream applications in other domains (e.g. computer vision, bioinformatics, recommendation). I am also particularly interested in the advances of <i>conditional</i> <strong>generative image modelling</strong> - a branch of generative models which has contributed ample insights to representation learning, in addition with
    <a href="/articles/17/computers-can-draw">inspiring applications</a> in vision/graphics.
</p>
<p>Prior to HUST, I had a brief but wonderful time at <a href="https://www.fpt-software.com/">FPT Software</a> Hanoi. In my early academic journey, I was a summer intern at Dr <a href="http://lenoverelab.org">Le Novere's lab</a>, also completed an M.Phil. in Computational Biology at <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge University</a> (2014), and a B.Sc. in Mathematics  with Finance  at <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/">Exeter University</a> (2013). Before that, I was a B.A. student at the <a href="http://bsneu.edu.vn/?q=en">Business school, National Economics University</a> for one year.
