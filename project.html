        Worked as AI engineer, Data scientist and Project manager to develop, analyze and deliver AI-based recommendation solutions for, but not limited to, e-Commerce & Digital Media business customers. Machine learnt algorithms were deployed and served to 6 million end-users in the last 12 months.

        Designed a novel, scalable, and interpretable Bayesian model which included textual description of the items for
        recommendation. The algorithm was evaluated on both public and real-life, commercial datasets in different
        recommendation settings, namely article recommendaiton and product recommendation. It showed noticeable
        improvement in prediction accuracy against other competitors with fast training time on CPU - thanks to
        optimization on convex-hull of the loss function.

        An early work that explored ConvNet for image tagging with single-scale input. The single-scale approach was
        different from e.g. R-CNN, YOLO framework in which multiple labels can be classified <em>without</em> extracting
        candidate regions before prediction, thus computational complexity is much lower at test time. Experiments on 2
        small-scale datasets showed competitve classification accuracy, though fell short in
        rank-wise retrieval metrics - which was believed to be amendable by training against pair-wise loss functions.
