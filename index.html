    <h1>Hoa M. Le</h1>
    <p>I am a research assistant/student at the <a href="http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn">Data Science Lab, Hanoi University of Science & Technology</a>, reading and working on statistical machine learning. My research interests include <strong>deep neural networks</strong> and <strong>latent variable models</strong>, with focus on <i>conditional generative image models</i>, and <i>multi-modal modelling</i> with <i>inference methods</i> that endorse interpretability and scalability for downstream applications in other domains (e.g. computer vision, bioinformatics, recommendation).
    </p>
    <p>In my academic journey, I have completed an M.Phil. in <strong>Computational Biology</strong> at <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge University</a> (2014) and a B.Sc. in <strong>Mathematics</strong>  with <strong>Finance</strong>  at <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/">Exeter University</a> (2013). Before that, I was a B.A. student at the <a href="http://bsneu.edu.vn/?q=en">Business school, National Economics University</a> for one year.
