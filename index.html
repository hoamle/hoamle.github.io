title: Hoa M. Le - The Three Sides

<div class="blurb">

    <h1>Hoa M. Le</h1>
    <p>I am a research assistant/student at the <a href="http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn">Data Science Lab, Hanoi University of Science & Technology</a> (HUST), reading and working on statistical machine learning. My research interests include <strong>deep neural networks</strong> and <strong>latent variable models</strong>, with focus on <i>multi-modal modelling</i> and <i>inference methods</i> that endorse interpretability and scalability for downstream applications in other domains (e.g. computer vision, bioinformatics, recommendation). I am also particularly interested in the advances of <i>conditional generative image modelling</i> - a branch of generative models which has contributed ample insights to structure learning, and
        <a href="/blog/2017/01/01/computers-can-draw">inspiring applications</a> in vision/graphics.
    </p>
    <p>Prior to HUST, I had a brief but wonderful time at <a href="https://www.fpt-software.com/">FPT Software</a> Hanoi. In my academic journey, I have completed an M.Phil. in <em>Computational Biology</em> at <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge University</a> (2014) and a B.Sc. in <em>Mathematics</em>  with <em>Finance</em>  at <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/">Exeter University</a> (2013). Before that, I was a B.A. student at the <a href="http://bsneu.edu.vn/?q=en">Business school, National Economics University</a> for one year.
