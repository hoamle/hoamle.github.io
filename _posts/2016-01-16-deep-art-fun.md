Last weekend I finally took some of personal photos and artwork to *\"paint\"* them in, but not limited to, Van Gogh style. The \"painting\" part was actually done by [**DeepArt algorithm**](#deepart){% sidenote "sn-id-artomatix" "It's worth to note that Artomatix, Inc. - an Irish startup - had introduced a [similar work](https://youtu.be/un9lSayNOIY?t=51) several months before DeepArt algorithm was published." %} - an inspiring application from **Deep learning** research. In short, the Deep learning model - a deep neural network - takes your photo (referred as ***content-image*** henceforth) and a reference style (combination of 1 or more ***style-images***) as the inputs and produces your photo in that style. 

## Demo
I used [jcjohnson's implementation](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style) of DeepArt algorithm for this demo. 

Here we have the content-image on the top-left, the style-image is an artwork by artist Leonid Afremov on the top-right, and the photo generated in Afremov\'s style at the bottom.

The machine did not "paint" the picture out of the blue, it\'s an iterative learning process. In short, it starts with a blank (noisy) canvas and tries to learn prominent features in both content-image and style-image(s) and present them on the final product. That learning process is mathematically expressed as optimization process of a function representing the combined *similarity* between the output and the inputs. Optimizing such function requires an algorithm which goes through series of updating iterations, visualized in the following gif.

## More images
*Note:* Due to hardware constrainst, most of images below were generated from *non-optimal* configs, thus did not yield their best output. I will be updating results from optimal configs soon enough.

## Observation
* **Size matters**. The higher the output image resolution, the more details in the content-image can be explicitly expressed by the indicated style. However, memory is a *big* trade-off. Default output image size (max. 512px-wide) on an NIN took as small as 5-600MB, but a 784px image devours 3 times as much! 
* For visual appeal, (i) an **expressive** style and/or (ii) **resemblance** between content-**Style image** pair is the key. \"Expressive\" here is not only about abstract or surreal in specific, but about texture i.e. discernible patterns in colors, strokes, blobs in general. Example work: *Leonid Afremov\'s painting, The Scream, Monet\'s water lilies,* etc. Eventually, using style-images referenced from complicated realism pieces by the old masters, e.g. Jean Leon Gerome, usually  yields unsatisfiying results. Secondly, although not always, content- and style-images of similar semantics pair well with each other. For example, a landscape picture should play along well with Starry Night or Wheat Field and the Crows; a portrait and one of Picasso\'s self-portraits also make a nice combination. 
* I drool over a Titan X.

## Hardware setup
The main work-horse is a humble 2GB nVidia GTX 660 GPU{% sidenote 'sn-gpu' 'i.e. common video graphic card for gaming' %} plugged in a dated LGA 775 desktop. <del>Each image was generated in ~90 seconds (for a 512px-image) or 2-3 mins (for a 784px-image)</del>{% sidenote "sn-id-advances" "[Recent advances](https://github.com/jcjohnson/fast-neural-style) have largely reduce generation time down to just *a few seconds*" %}. GPU(s) with generous memory is desirable.

It\'s *much* faster to run DeepArt algorithm on GPU(s) instead of common CPUs. Even a modern i7 K-series can take upto hour to train and generate 1 image of above sizes. However, running on CPU can take advantages of *abundant* host memory (easily >8GB on a single machine), not to mention the possibility to be accompanied with a coprocessor (eg: Xeon Phi), or running on distributed platform.
