Training sessions for new members at DSLab. Pre-requisite for subsequent sessions in Topic models and (supervised) Deep neural networks. 

Intended learning objectives: understand data analysis and modelling pipeline; fundamentals of machine learning: regression and classification, model formalisation by graphical models, (Bayesian) inference/learning, batch/stochastic gradient descent, (non)-linear classification with neural networks, latent variable models, and overview of approximate posterior inference.
