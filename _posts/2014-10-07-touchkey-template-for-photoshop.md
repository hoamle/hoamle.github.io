**TouchKey** is one of few especially useful on-screen toolbars for Windows Tablet PCs. It makes using Windows tablets without keyboard much more comfortable. The software is developed by [**kannagi**](http://kannagi.net/touchkey/).

This repository is a toolbar *template*, specifically designed for painting in Adobe (R) Photoshop (R). Icon design is kindly provided by [**Konartist3D**](http://forum.tabletpcreview.com/threads/artdock-for-the-samsung-series-7-slate.47958/) and [**dream3**](http://forum.tabletpcreview.com/threads/artdock-guide-compatibility-and-links.58400/page-6#post-413194) at TabletPC Review forum.
