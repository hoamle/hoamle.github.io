Survey on the attempts to build an AI artist

## History
- AARON (Harold Cohen)
- "The Painting Fool" (Simon Colton)
- "The Next Rembrandt" (TU Delft)
- Machine learning

## Modern advances 

### Non Photo-realistic Rendering (NPR)
- physic-based: NPR book 
- data-driven: texture/style transfer, e.g. Artomatix (Erric Risser et al), Neural Art (Gatys et al)

### Generative model of images
- Restricted Boltzman Machine (RBM)
- Variational Auto Encoder (VAE), Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer (DRAW)
- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
- PixelRNN
- __PPGN__: Generative net + conditioned + activation maximisation + prior structure = photo-realistic image generation!!
(inner-thought: 18-month ago this vague idea of "creative AI" drove me to machine/deep learning, and here we are!!)

## Applications in graphics
- iGAN (Jun-Yan Zhu et al)
- StyLit (Jakub Fi≈°er et al)
- Colorisation (various) (note-to-self: `r/colorization` might be a good place to crawl labelled data)
- Texture propagation (Satoshi Iizuaka et al)
- Sketch cleaning (Satoshi Iizuaka et al)
- Super-resolution
- ...
