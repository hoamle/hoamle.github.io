### <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning">Essence of Machine Learning (and Deep Learning)</a>

Preliminary course for new members at DSLab-HUST. Pre-requisite for sessions in *Topic models* and (supervised) *Deep neural networks*. 
`<`[`Read more`](/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning)`>`

This short course aims to introduce new starters to the field of Machine Learning (ML) with a principled approach, so that ones can understand the motivation and intuition behind ML (and eventually Deep Learning - DL) concepts,  later learn advanced materials more efficiently, catch up with recent advances in the field, and be ready to do ML research and/or industrial applications.

### Introduction to Data Analytics

Data Analytics cores, pipeline, technical aspects, and applications in daily-life, business, science, technology and arts. 
*Guest speaking session* at [CareerMe](http://mycareerme.com/recap-hoi-thao-data-analytics/), a start-up providing career orientation service. Joint-talk with [Linh Nghiem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linhnghiem).

<i>Data Analytics</i>, <i>Data Science</i>, and <i>Big Data</i> have been the trending words that appear frequently even on mainstream media. However, the terms address a wide spectrum of disciplines and often used arbitrarily, thus may confuse aspiring students or early starters. Nevertheless, their foundation might have been very familiar to many people without noticing <i>(spoiler: statistics, econometrics, ...)</i>. The objective of this talk is to de-mystify these terms, presenting the fundamentals and the big picture in data analytics, discussing career prospect, and sharing relevant experiences from the speakers.
