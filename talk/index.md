### <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning">Essence of Machine Learning (and Deep Learning)</a>

"Base" course for new members at DSLab-HUST. Pre-requisite for subsequent training sessions in *Topic models* (or *Probabilistic Graphical Models*) and *Deep Learning*. 

**Motivation.** The majority of DSLab-HUST members, including myself back in early 2016, are aspiring ML ***self-learners***, and have been struggling (*a lot*) to study **probabilistic/Bayesian modelling** on our own. For the newcomers - who are very likely exposed to Deep Neural Networks (DNN) *before* probabilistic modelling - I found it considerably more challenging and time-consuming to see the [big picture of Machine Learning](/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning#map) (*Deep Learning* included) research without *proper background in probabilistic (graphical) models - PGM* (which I wish I had known earlier).

Nevertheless, it's truly hard to find a beginner-level MOOC in PGM{% sidenote 'sn-id-mooc' "Prof. [Daphne Koller's course in PGM](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models) is a little bit abstract, and not a beginner-level course on ML" %} which can instill (i) probabilistic/statistical reasoning, and also introduce (ii) [ML core concepts](/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning#core) in a intuitive flow as Prof. [Andrew Ng's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) did. Therefore, this course is devised to address the 2 purposes. Upon completing this course, the learners can, hopefully, explore the spectrum of ML research with minimal guidance, keep their heads up on the big picture to not get lost in the complexity (and the hype!) of the field, later learn advanced materials more efficiently, and catch up with recent advances in Machine Learning research.

### Introduction to Data Analytics

Data Analytics cores, pipeline, technical aspects, and applications in daily-life, business, science, technology and arts. 
*Guest speaking session* at [CareerMe](http://mycareerme.com/recap-hoi-thao-data-analytics/), a start-up providing career orientation service. Joint-talk with [Linh Nghiem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linhnghiem).

<i>Data Analytics</i>, <i>Data Science</i>, and <i>Big Data</i> have been the trending words that appear frequently even on mainstream media. However, the terms address a wide spectrum of disciplines and often used arbitrarily, thus may confuse aspiring students or early starters. Nevertheless, their foundation might have been very familiar to many people without noticing <i>(spoiler: statistics, econometrics, ...)</i>. The objective of this talk is to de-mystify these terms, presenting the fundamentals and the big picture in data analytics, discussing career prospect, and sharing relevant experiences from the speakers.
