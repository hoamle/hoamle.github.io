### <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning">Essence of Machine Learning (and Deep Learning)</a>

Preliminary course for new members at DSLab-HUST. Pre-requisite for sessions in *Topic models* and (supervised) *Deep neural networks*. 

*Motivation.* Students at DSLab-HUST have been struggling moving from reading Deep neural networks to Probabilistic models and vice-versa. This short course, therefore, is introduced to guide new starters to the field of Machine Learning with a more ***principled approach***, so that ones can understand the motivation and intuition behind ML concepts (which eventually includes *Deep Learning* along the course), keep their heads up on the big picture to not get lost in the complexity of the field, later learn advanced materials efficiently and catch up with recent advances in Machine Learning.

### Introduction to Data Analytics

Data Analytics cores, pipeline, technical aspects, and applications in daily-life, business, science, technology and arts. 
*Guest speaking session* at [CareerMe](http://mycareerme.com/recap-hoi-thao-data-analytics/), a start-up providing career orientation service. Joint-talk with [Linh Nghiem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linhnghiem).

<i>Data Analytics</i>, <i>Data Science</i>, and <i>Big Data</i> have been the trending words that appear frequently even on mainstream media. However, the terms address a wide spectrum of disciplines and often used arbitrarily, thus may confuse aspiring students or early starters. Nevertheless, their foundation might have been very familiar to many people without noticing <i>(spoiler: statistics, econometrics, ...)</i>. The objective of this talk is to de-mystify these terms, presenting the fundamentals and the big picture in data analytics, discussing career prospect, and sharing relevant experiences from the speakers.
