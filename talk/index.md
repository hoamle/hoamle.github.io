<i>Data Analytics</i>, <i>Data Science</i>, and <i>Big Data</i> have been the trending words that appear frequently even on mainstream media. However, the terms address a wide spectrum of disciplines and often used arbitrarily, thus may confuse aspiring students or early starters. Nevertheless, their foundation might have been very familiar to many people without noticing <i>(spoiler: statistics, econometrics, ...)</i>. The objective of this talk is to de-mystify these terms, presenting the fundamentals and the big picture in data analytics, discussing career prospect, and sharing relevant experiences from the speakers.
