### Essence of Machine Learning (and Deep Learning)
{% marginfigure 'mf-id-1' 'assets/img/rhino.png' '*TODO* [[Read more](/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning)]'%}

Training course for new members at DSLab. Pre-requisite for subsequent sessions in *Topic models* and (supervised) *Deep neural networks*. 

*Abstract*. There are literally *hundreds* of Machine Learning (ML) models/algorithms published every year. The field itself is also broad enough, with many sub-areas that require in-depth pre-requisites. While the current wave of AI/ML has brought up numbers of ML study materials to wider audience than ever, it also create lots of noises, e.g. "sensational science" reads from mainstream articles and online discussion, or redundant "how-to" tutorials which usually neglect question "why". All of these may hinder aspiring starters who want to *get serious* on ML (and understand what Deep Learning - DL is and does exactly), making their learning pace not optimal.

This short course aims to introduce new starters to the field of ML with a principled approach, so that ones can understand the motivation and intuition behind ML (and eventually DL) concepts,  later learn advanced materials more efficiently, catch up with recent advances in the field, and be ready to do ML research and/or industrial applications.

    <h3>Introduction to Data Analytics</h3>
    <p>
        <small><i>(in Vietnamese)</i></small>
        <br>Data Analytics: cores, pipeline, technical aspects, and applications in daily-life,
        business, science, technology and arts. Guest speaking session at <a
            href="http://mycareerme.com/recap-hoi-thao-data-analytics/">CareerMe</a>, a
        start-up providing career orientation service. Joint-talk with <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/linhnghiem">Linh Nghiem</a>.
    </p>
    <p><i>Data Analytics</i>, <i>Data Science</i>, and <i>Big Data</i> have been the trending
        words that appear frequently even on mainstream media. However, the terms address a
        wide spectrum of disciplines and often used arbitrarily, thus may confuse aspiring
        students or early starters. Nevertheless, their foundation might have been very
        familiar to many people without noticing <i>(spoiler: statistics, econometrics,
            ...)</i>. The objective of this talk is to de-mystify these terms, presenting the
        fundamentals and the big picture in data analytics, discussing career prospect, and sharing relevant
        experiences from the speakers.
