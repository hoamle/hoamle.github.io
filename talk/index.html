    <h2>Introduction to Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h2>
    <p>Training sessions for new members at DSLab. Pre-requisite for subsequent sessions in <i>Topic
        models</i> and <i>(supervised) Deep neural networks</i>.
    </p>
    <p>Intended learning objectives:
        understand data analysis and modelling pipeline; fundamentals of machine learning:
        regression
        and classification, model formalisation by graphical models, (Bayesian)
        inference/learning, batch/stochastic gradient descent, (non)-linear classification with
        neural networks, latent variable models, and overview of approximate posterior
        inference.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to Data Analytics</h2>
    <p>
        <small><i>(in Vietnamese)</i></small>
        <br>Data Analytics: cores, pipeline, technical aspects, and applications in daily-life,
        business, science, technology and arts. Guest speaking session at <a
            href="http://mycareerme.com/recap-hoi-thao-data-analytics/">CareerMe</a>, a
        start-up providing career orientation service. Joint-talk with <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/linhnghiem">Linh Nghiem</a>.
    </p>
    <p><i>Data Analytics</i>, <i>Data Science</i>, and <i>Big Data</i> have been the trending
        words that appear frequently even on mainstream media. However, the terms address a
        wide spectrum of disciplines and often used arbitrarily, thus may confuse aspiring
        students or early starters. Nevertheless, their foundation might have been very
        familiar to many people without noticing <i>(spoiler: statistics, econometrics,
            ...)</i>. The objective of this talk is to de-mystify these terms, presenting the
        fundamentals and the big picture in data analytics, discussing career prospect, and sharing relevant
        experiences from the speakers.
