## Recommender Systems
---
### **Recommendation with Deep Learning in the Wild**
*Summary*: Develop recommendation algorithms for world-wide clients as a Data Scientist at [NextSmarty](https://www.nextsmarty.com/).

*Type*: Industry Project (2017 - now)

*Status*: Non-disclosed

### **Hybrid Content-based Collaborative Filtering Probabilistic Model**
<!-- {% maincolumn 'assets/img/cnnat.png' '' %} -->
*Summary*: A novel, scalable, and interpretable Bayesian machine learning model which includes textual description of the items. The algorithm was evaluated on real-life, public and private datasets in 3 different recommendation tasks, and shows noticeable improvement in prediction accuracy against other competitors, as well as fast training time. 

*Type*: Academic Project (2016 - 2017)

*Status*: Published. `[`[`Paper`](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijar.2018.02.001)`]`

### **Recommendation for videos**
*Summary*: Work on a video recomendation system as a developer at FPT Software.

*Type*: Industry Project (2015 - 2016)

*Status*: Non-disclosed

### **Multi-label Image Classification by ConvNet and Adaptive Thresholding**
<!-- {% maincolumn 'assets/img/cnnat.png' '' %} -->
<img align="center" src="/assets/img/cnnat.png"><br>
*Summary*: One of the early works which adopt ConvNet for multi-label classification. This work differs from the others, at the time of publishing, in which number of labels can be inferred adaptively, rather than being fixed at test time. Experiments with 2 small-scale datasets shows significant improvement in classification accuracy, and some expected drawbacks in ranking measures.

*Type*: Academic Project (2016 - 2016)

*Status*: Published. `[`[`Paper`](https://doi.org/10.1145/3011077.3011118)`]` `[`[`Code`](https://github.com/hoamle/multiLabel)`]`

### **Artistic Style Transfer on Mobile Devices**
*Summary*: Apply variants of style transer technique - the most recent advances in data-driven non-photorealistic rendering - to develop the core image processing service of a "smart" editing mobile app.

*Type*: Freelancing Project (2017 - 2017)

*Status*: Prototype

### **Game Modding**
*Summary*: Build and inject high-quality 3D models into a retro 90's game, which significantly improves visual aesthetics of the game. The injection was possible thanks to community-deveoped tools that help import/export the game assets. 

*Type*: Community Project (2007 - 2009)

*Status*: Alpha-release (abandoned due to legal concern at the time)


## Democratizing Science

### **Machine Learning (and Deep Learning) under Probabilistic Perspective**
{% maincolumn 'assets/img/mapofML_crop.png' "" %}
*Summary*: A 6-week course with the objective of introducing [**core concepts of machine learning under probabilistic perspective**](/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning/), **using simpler language**. Upon completing this course, the learners can, hopefully, explore the spectrum of ML/AI research with minimal guidance, keep their heads up on the big picture to not get lost in the complexity (and the hype!) of the field, later learn advanced materials more efficiently, and catch up with the latest advances.

*Type*: Personal Project

*Status*: Work-in-progress. `[`[`Read more`](/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning)`]`

*Motivation*: The majority of DSLab-HUST members, including myself back in late 2015, were aspiring ML *self-learners*, but struggled to study **probabilistic/Bayesian modelling** on our own. For the newcomers - who are very likely exposed to Deep Neural Networks (DNN) first - a *proper foundation* in probabilistic modelling is one of the most important foundation to see the [big picture of Machine Learning](/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning#map) (*Deep Learning* included), and to advance in the field. Nevertheless, it's truly hard to find an entry-level MOOC which can introduce (i) fundamentals of probabilistic modelling, and  (ii) [ML core concepts](/articles/16/essence-machine-deep-learning#core) in an intuitive structure as Prof. [Andrew Ng's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) did. Therefore, this course is devised to serve the 2 purposes.
